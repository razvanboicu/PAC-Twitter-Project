# About

Colibri is a Twitter clone we created as a project assignment for the modern C++ course. It offers its users features such as adding posts, interacting with them(likes,dislikes,retweets), adding friends etc. 

Through this project we learned to:
* develop a client server application using modern C++ features
* create a GUI using SFML
* socket programming using Winsock

# Project components

* we created the widgets we needed for the project(buttons, textboxes etc) using SFML
* the server is able to handle multiple clients at once, we implemented it using a threadpool and every new connection is assigned to a worker thread
